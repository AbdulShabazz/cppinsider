Billing Policy:

My billing rate is a set rate per written line of functional code. Please note the following specifics regarding what is considered a billable line of code:

    Functional Code: Lines of code which validate, clarify or are part of the actual functionality of the software are considered billable line of code. 
    
    These include logic, declarations, statements, and function calls that contribute to the intended features and behavior of the application.

    Exclusions: The following are not considered in the billing:
        Comments: Any line of code that is a comment (e.g., starts with // in JavaScript or # in Python) which does not pertain to a feature or behavior and does not contribute towards the intended or desired functionality is not billable.
        Boilerplate Code: Standard code that is used to set up the structure of the application and doesn't pertain to a feature or behavior and does not contribute towards the intended or desired functionality is not billable.
        Whitespace: Empty lines or lines containing only whitespace which do not contribute towards the code's readability are not considered billable.

    Code Review: For transparency, I am happy to review the code with you to break down which lines are considered billable according to the aforementioned criteria.
