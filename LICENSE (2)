GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that You
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if You wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published
    by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at Your option) any later version.

  GENERAL TERMS OF SERVICE (TOS)

  Definitions

    An "Account" if granted represents Your legal relationship with the site. 
    
    A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in 
    to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on the site.
    
    “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single 
    entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across 
    many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of 
    Organizations.
    
    The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices 
    contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") 
    and all other operating rules, policies (including the sites Privacy Guidelines, 
    provided herein) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on 
    the Website. All of Our site policies are available on the site.
    
    "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, 
    beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with 
    similar meanings.
    
    “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, 
    including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, 
    graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other 
    materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through 
    the Service. 
    
    "Content" also includes Services. 
    
    “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or 
    uploaded by Our Users. 
    
    "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
    
    “C++ Insider,” “C++ Insider,” “We,” and “Us” refer to C++ Insider, as well as 
    Our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, 
    agents, and employees.
    
    The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services 
    provided by the site, including any Beta Previews.
    
    “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or 
    organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that 
    accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the 
    Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 
    12 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government 
    Accounts (See Additional Terms).
    
    The “Website” refers to C++ Insider's website located at cppinsider.com, 
    and all content, services, and products provided by Us at or through the 
    Website. It also refers to owned subdomains of cppinsider.com. These 
    Terms also govern Our conference websites, if there be any. Occasionally, 
    websites owned by Us may provide different or additional terms of service. 
    If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific 
    terms apply to the relevant page or service.

 Billing Policy:

  The billing rate is a set rate per written line of code. Please note
  the following specifics regarding what is considered a billable line of code:

  Functional Code: 

Lines of code which validate, clarify or are part of the actual functionality of
the software are considered billable lines of code. 

These include logic, declarations, statements, and function calls that contribute
to the intended features and behavior of the application.

  Inclusions

The following are considered in billing:

Comments: Any line of code that is a comment (e.g., starts with // in JavaScript
or # in Python) which elucidates a feature or behavior and contributes towards 
the intended or desired functionality is billable.

Boilerplate Code: Standard code that explains how to set up the structure of the
application in a way that contributes towards the intended or desired functionality
is billable.

Whitespace: Empty lines or lines containing only whitespace which contribute 
towards the code's readability, usability and or functionality are considered 
billable.

Documentation: Documentation which has been cultivated on behalf of the customer, 
especially comprehensive documentation, shall be considered
billable.

Code Review: For transparency, We are happy to review the code with You to break down
which lines are billable according to the aforementioned criteria.

  Automated Testing

Instead of having customers submit test cases, We may in the future create an 
automated testing framework. With such a framework, customers would no longer 
need to input their test cases with expected output, and the system would 
automatically test Your algorithm against proper these cases. This would both 
save time and ensure consistency across different tests. Such a system may be 
developed in the future, at our discretion.

  Cloud-Based Compilation

Instead of deliverable binaries, in the future we may at Our discretion, use 
cloud-based processing where source code can be compiled and run. This allows for 
greater portability and accessibility since You the customer would not have to 
worry about attaining the minimum hardware or software on Your own machine(s). 
It also eliminates the need for You the customer to download and install 
any binaries.

  Prohibited Actions

In using the Services, You may not and may not allow any third party, 
including Your end users, to:

    Create a derived binary to Send, upload, distribute or disseminate 
      or offer to do the same with respect to any unlawful, defamatory, 
      harassing, abusive, fraudulent, infringing, obscene, or otherwise 
      objectionable content;

    Intentionally distribute viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, 
      corrupted files, hoaxes, or any other items of a destructive or 
      deceptive nature;

    Conduct or forward pyramid schemes and the like;

    Transmit content that may be harmful to minors;

    Impersonate another person (via the use of an email address or otherwise)

    Use the Service to attack or tamper with other websites, services, 
      and individuals;

    Perform significant load testing without first obtaining written consent 
      (email permitted), as otherwise these may be treated as denial-of-service attacks;

    Launch any automated system, including without limitation, “robots”, “spiders”,
      or “offline readers” that access the Service in a manner that sends more request 
      messages or any other content to the servers in a given period of time than a 
      human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional online 
      web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may grant the operators of public 
      search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the 
      sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available 
      searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. 
      We reserve the right to revoke these exceptions either generically or in specific 
      cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, 
      including account names, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems 
      provided by the Services for any commercial solicitation purposes. 
      You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any other users of the Service 
      with respect to their content.

    Rent, lease, loan, or sell access to, or otherwise attempt to transfer any right 
      from Our website (which includes its software and documentation) to a third-party, 
      through framing or any other method;

    Modify, adapt, translate, or reverse engineer any portion of the Service. 
      Without limitation You may not engage in practices of “screen scraping,” 
      “database scraping” or any other practice or activity the purpose of which 
      is to obtain lists of users, portions of a database, copy visuals or business 
      methods, binaries, or other lists or information from the Service, in any 
      manner and any quantities not authorized in writing or for use for 
      competitive purposes;

    Engage in attacks designed to extract or steal trained machine learning 
      models (MLMs/LLMs) used by Us or Our third party service providers.

  Payment Integration

If the payment process remains separate from the rest of the process, we may 
in the future integrate payment processing directly into Our platform. 
This would make the user experience smoother and could lead to more convenient 
sales.

By using Our payment processing services and other payment methods that we may offer 
from time to time (“Payment Services”), You agree to be bound by the General 
Terms of Service (“General Terms”), these additional terms and conditions 
(“Payment Terms”) and all other terms, policies and guidelines applicable to the Services 
(as defined in the General Terms) used. If You are using the Payment Services on behalf
 of a business, that business accepts these terms and You represent to Us that You have 
 authority to bind that business or entity to these terms. Payment Services may only be 
 used for business purposes in the fifty states of the United States of America and the 
 District of Columbia. Defined terms will have the same meaning as those found in the 
 General Terms, unless otherwise re-defined herein.

In addition, other payment methods that we offer may have additional restrictions. 
Please review the terms provided for each payment method for further detail.

  API services

If we develop an algorithm that can be generalized, we may consider providing it as an API service. 
This way, clients can directly integrate Your algorithms into their existing 
systems at a charge based on the usage.

You are responsible for safeguarding the passwords You use to access the Service and agree 
to be fully responsible for activities or transactions that relate to Your account or password. 
You must notify Us immediately if You learn of an unauthorized use of Your  account or password. 

  Comprehensive Documentation and Support

Comprehensive Documentation and Support may in the future be made available as a 
service, along with Support channels such as chat and or email to answer questions 
or troubleshoot any issues Our customers may face. For a convenience to Our customers, 
Large Language Models (LLMs) may be trained on the resulting documentation, 
to which Our customers can then provide queries against to check the robustness
of the the documentation. We may also provide You the customer 
with access to a variety of resources, including interactive training tutorials, 
documentation, videos, developer tools, download areas, communication forums and 
product information (collectively the "Services"). The Services, including any 
updates, enhancements, new features, and/or the addition of any new Web properties, 
are also subject to the Terms of Service (TOS), therein.

  Personal and Non-Commercial Use Limitation

Unless otherwise specified, the Services are for Your personal and or commercial use. 
You may modify, copy, distribute, transmit, publicly display, perform, reproduce, 
publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer or sell any information, 
software, products or services obtained from the Services (which includes for Your 
own, personal, or commercial use) without prior written consent.

  Version Control and Updates

If You're providing source code, consider using a version control system like Git 
and hosting the repository on a service like GitHub or Bitbucket. This would make 
distributing updates and bug fixes easier, and it would also allow us to 
easily track changes made to the code.

  Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Our site may make Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools 
available. Adopting these tools can help You identify bugs and issues early on, 
improving the overall quality of Your software. Your use of the Website and 
Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark 
laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in Your jurisdiction. You 
are responsible for making sure that Your use of the Service is in compliance 
with laws and any applicable regulations. We reserve the right to refuse or 
remove any User-Generated Content that, in Our sole discretion, violates any 
laws or site terms or policies.

  API Terms

You agree to these Terms of Service when using any of our site's APIs 
(Application Programmer Interface), including use of the API through a 
third-party product that relies on the site.

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the site via the API may result in 
the temporary or permanent suspension of Your Account's access to the API. 
We in Our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. 
We will make a reasonable attempt to warn You via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed pre-established rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content, especially from GitHub for 
spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal 
information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the API is subject to these Terms of Service and the GitHub 
Privacy Statement.

We may offer subscription-based access to Our API for those Users who require 
higher-throughput access or access that would result in resale of the site's 
Service.

  Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If You're posting 
anything You did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, You agree 
that You are responsible for any Content You post; that You will only submit 
Content that You have the right to post; and that You will fully comply with 
any third party licenses relating to Content You post.

Because You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need 
You to grant Us — and Our developers — certain legal permissions: These license 
grants apply to Your Content. If You upload Content that already comes with a 
license granting Us the permissions we need to run Our Service, no additional 
license is required. You understand that You will not receive any payment for 
any of the rights granted to Us. The licenses You grant to Us will not end when 
we or You remove Your Content from Our servers, and that we may grant the 
results and benefits of uploaded content and licenses to other users.

  License Grant to Us

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and 
share it. You grant Us and Our legal successors the right to store, archive, 
parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to 
provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license 
includes the right to do things like copy it to Our database and make backups; 
show it to You and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise 
analyze it on Our servers; share it with other users.

This license grants Us the right to sell similar or identical content to Yours. 
It also grants Us the right to reproduce or distribute similar or derived works 
from your content. We may not otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside 
of Our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive 
Your Content. We may permit Our partners to store and archive Your Content in 
a manner that is required for the normal operation of Our services.

  License Grant to Other Users

Any User-Generated Content You post publicly, including issues, comments, and 
contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting 
Your repositories to be viewed publicly, You agree to allow others to 
view and "fork" Your repositories (this means that others may make their own 
copies of Content from Your repositories in repositories they control).

If You set Your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, You grant each 
User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform 
Your Content through the hosting Service and to reproduce Your Content solely 
on the hosting service site as permitted through the site's functionality 
(for example, through Github forking). You may grant further rights if You 
adopt a license. If You are uploading Content You did not create or own, You 
are responsible for ensuring that the Content You upload is licensed under 
terms that grant these permissions to other Users of the hosting service.

  Contributions Under Repository License

Whenever You add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, You 
license that Content under the same terms, and You agree that You have the 
right to license that Content under those terms. If You have a separate 
agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor 
license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

  Moral Rights

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that You upload, publish, or submit 
to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. 
However, You waive these rights and agree not to assert them against Us, 
to enable Us to reasonably exercise the rights granted, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, You grant Us 
the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable 
adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the 
Service.

  Billing Schedule; No Refunds

The invoiced Users or User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front 
without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. The User may pay the 
fees up to thirty (30) days after the invoice date. Amounts payable under this 
Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 
User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental 
assessments that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

  Authorization

By agreeing to these Terms, You are giving Us permission to charge Your on-file 
credit card, PayPal, or other approved method(s) of payment for fees that You 
authorize.

  We May Terminate

This site has the right to suspend or terminate Your access to all or any part 
of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, 
effective immediately. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone 
for any reason at any time.

  Survival

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive 
termination will survive termination — including, without limitation: 
ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of 
liability.

  Electronic Communication Required

For contractual purposes, You (1) consent to receive communications from Us in 
an electronic form via the email address You have submitted or via the Service; 
and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, 
and other communications that we provide to You electronically satisfy any legal 
requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. 
This section does not affect Your non-waivable rights.

  Legal Notice to Us Must Be in Writing

Communications made through email or Support's messaging system will not 
constitute legal notice to Us, Our site, or any of its officers, employees, agents 
or representatives in any situation where notice is required by contract or any 
law or regulation. Legal notice must be in writing and served to the site's 
legal agent.

  No Phone Support

This site only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and 
electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

  Disclaimer of Warranties

We provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without 
warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all 
warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website 
and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, 
fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

We do not warrant that the Service will meet Your requirements; that the Service

provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects 
or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any 
particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other 
harmful components. 

You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from Your downloading 
and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the 
Service.

  Limitation of Liability

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to You or any third party 
for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, 
indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that 
result from:

    the use, disclosure, or display of Your User-Generated Content;
    Your use or inability to use the Service;
    any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
    the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
    unauthorized access to or alterations of Your transmissions or data;
    statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
    any other user interactions that You input or receive through Your use of 
    the Service; or any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility 
of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to 
have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure 
or delay due to matters beyond Our reasonable control.

  Release and Indemnification

If You have a dispute with one or more Users, You agree to release the site 
from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every 
kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with 
such disputes.

You agree to indemnify Us, defend Us, and hold Us harmless from and against any 
and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising 
out of Your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to Your 
violation of this Agreement, provided that the site (1) promptly gives You 
written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives You sole 
control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding 
(provided that You may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding 
unless the settlement unconditionally releases Us of all liability); 
and (3) provides to You all reasonable assistance, at Your expense.

  Severability, No Waiver, and Survival

If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion 
of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent. 
The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any failure on 
the part of Us to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be 
considered a waiver of Our right to enforce such provision. Our rights under 
this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.
